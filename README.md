# Lunar - Video Streaming service using Reactjs

Made by: Shashwat(me), [Priyanshi Meghwani](https://github.com/priyanshi23meghwani) and [Saumya Singh](https://github.com/saumyaseek)
This is our final year project which is still under construction.

In this WebApp we could search and play videos. 
we could post photos with caption, which every body could see.
This webApp is built using YouTubeAPI.

## Design 
Everything is designed before hand in the wireframing and designing Software `Figma`.
Since our project is still in construction, I don't want to give away the full design, but I will soon upload the full design.
